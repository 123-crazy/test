<!-- Note: This file is intended to be attached to a Teamcenter dataset and then 
    'injected' into an XML Stylesheet rendering (XRT) file.
    
    For example, assuming the following:
        The dataset name is: 'htmlPanel_tcoo1' 
        The associated JavaScript source is deployed at: 'js/htmlPanel_tcoo1'
        
        The XRT would include the example as a new page using the following tags:
        ...
        <page titleKey="tcoo1">
            <inject type="dataset" src="htmlPanel_tcoo1" module="js/htmlPanel_tcoo1" ></inject>
        </page>
     
     Also note that ng-controller is associated with "tcooController" and 
     that iframe is using ng-src and is bound to the variable "url".
-->
<div id="aw-tcoo-panel" ng-controller="tcooController">
    <iframe class="aw-tcoo-frame" ng-src="{{url}}"></iframe>
</div>
